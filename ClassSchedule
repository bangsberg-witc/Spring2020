List of Virtual Class times for Spring 2020, all students welcome  in-class and online all are welcome.

As we transition into the "Covid-Spring" semester with all in-class courses changed to online, Rene and I are trying to find a schedule that will work the best for everyone.

Starting Monday 3/30/2020,  I will have a BlackBoard collaborate for each class.
Any class that started before 9:00 am, will now start at 9:00 am

Here is the schedule for 3/30/2020 - 4/3/2020
Monday:     Apps Dev:  11:00 am - 2:00 pm

Tuesday:    Ent .Net:  9:00 am - 12:00 pm
               Adv .Net:  12:30 pm - 3:30pm

Wednesday:  Prog SQL:  9:00 am - 12:00 pm

Please plan on attending the classes as listed, you will use blackboard collaborate to join the class.

After this first week we will re-evaluate the times to tweak the schedule to find what works best for everyone.

Stay Safe!
